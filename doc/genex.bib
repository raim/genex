abstract = "The hypergeometric function of a real variable is computed for arbitrary real parameters. The transformation theory of the hypergeometric function is used to obtain rapidly convergent power series. The divergences that occur in the individual terms of the transformation for integer parameters are removed using a finite difference technique."
