The transformation theory of the hypergeometric function is used to obtain rapidly convergent power series. The divergences that occur in the individual terms of the transformation for integer parameters are removed using a finite difference technique."

        abstract = {The repressilator is a regulatory cycle of n genes where each
gene represses its  successor in the cycle: [see text]. The system
is modelled by ODEs for an arbitrary number of identical genes
and arbitrarily strong repressor binding. A detailed mathematical
analysis of the dynamical behavior is provided for two model systems:
(i) a repressilator with leaky transcription and single-step cooperative
repressor binding, and (ii) a repressilator with auto-activation
and  cooperative regulator binding. Genes are assumed to be present
in constant amounts, transcription and translation are modelled
by single-step kinetics, and  mRNAs as well as proteins are assumed
to be degraded by first order reactions. Several dynamical patterns
are observed: multiple steady states, periodic and aperiodic oscillations
corresponding to limit cycles and heteroclinic cycles, respectively.
The results of computer simulations are complemented by a detailed
and complete stability analysis of all equilibria and of the heteroclinic
cycle.}
