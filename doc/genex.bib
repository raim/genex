The transformation theory of the hypergeometric function is used to obtain rapidly convergent power series. The divergences that occur in the individual terms of the transformation for integer parameters are removed using a finite difference technique."

        abstract = {The repressilator is a regulatory cycle of n genes where each
gene represses its  successor in the cycle: [see text]. The system
is modelled by ODEs for an arbitrary number of identical genes
and arbitrarily strong repressor binding. A detailed mathematical
analysis of the dynamical behavior is provided for two model systems:
(i) a repressilator with leaky transcription and single-step cooperative
repressor binding, and (ii) a repressilator with auto-activation
and  cooperative regulator binding. Genes are assumed to be present
in constant amounts, transcription and translation are modelled
by single-step kinetics, and  mRNAs as well as proteins are assumed
to be degraded by first order reactions. Several dynamical patterns
are observed: multiple steady states, periodic and aperiodic oscillations
corresponding to limit cycles and heteroclinic cycles, respectively.
The results of computer simulations are complemented by a detailed
and complete stability analysis of all equilibria and of the heteroclinic
cycle.}

depends on well-characterized, robust promoters with predictable
input-output responses. While great progress has been made with
heterotrophic model organisms such as Escherichia coli, the available
variety of tunable promoter parts for phototrophic cyanobacteria
is still limited. Commonly used synthetic and semisynthetic promoters
show weak dynamic ranges or no regulation at all in cyanobacterial
models. Well-controlled alternatives such as native metal-responsive
promoters, however, pose the problems of inducer toxicity and
lacking orthogonality. Here, we present the comparative assessment
of dose-response functions of four different inducible promoter
systems in the model cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803.
Using the novel bimodular reporter plasmid pSHDY, dose-response
dynamics of the re-established vanillate-inducible promoter PvanCC
was compared to the previously described rhamnose-inducible Prha,
the anhydrotetracycline-inducible PL03, and the Co(2+)-inducible
PcoaT. We estimate individual advantages and disadvantages regarding
dynamic range and strength of each promoter, also in comparison
with well-established constitutive  systems. We observed a delicate
balance between transcription factor toxicity and sufficient expression
to obtain a dose-dependent response to the inducer. In summary,
we expand the current understanding and employability of inducible
promoters in cyanobacteria, facilitating the scalability and robustness
of synthetic regulatory network designs and of complex metabolic
pathway engineering strategies.}

        abstract = {BACKGROUND: Inducible promoters are widely spread genetic tools
for triggering, tuning and optimizing the expression of recombinant
genes in engineered biological systems. Most of them are controlled
by the addition of a specific exogenous chemical inducer that
indirectly regulates the promoter transcription rate in a concentration-dependent
fashion. In order to have a robust and predictable degree of control
on promoter activity, the degradation rate of such  chemicals
should be considered in many applications like recombinant protein
production. RESULTS: In this work, we use whole-cell biosensors
to assess the half-life of three commonly used chemical inducers
for recombinant Escherichia coli: Isopropyl beta-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside
(IPTG), anhydrotetracycline (ATc)  and N-(3-oxohexanoyl)-L-homoserine
lactone (HSL). A factorial study was conducted to investigate
the conditions that significantly contribute to the decay rate
of  these inducers. Temperature has been found to be the major
factor affecting ATc,  while medium and pH have been found to
highly affect HSL. Finally, no significant degradation was observed
for IPTG among the tested conditions. CONCLUSIONS: We have quantified
the decay rate of IPTG, ATc and HSL in many conditions, some of
which were not previously tested in the literature, and the main
effects affecting their degradation were identified via a statistics-based
framework. Whole-cell biosensors were successfully used to conduct
this study, yielding reproducible measurements via simple multiwell-compatible
assays. The knowledge of inducer degradation rate in several contexts
has to be considered in the rational design of synthetic biological
systems for improving the predictability  of induction effects,
especially for prolonged experiments.}
